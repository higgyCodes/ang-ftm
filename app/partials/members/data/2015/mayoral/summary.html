<h4>Race Summary</h4>

<p> 
	The result of the Mayoral Election between Jackie Biskupski and Ralph Becker yeilded some interesting results that might factor into future election cycles, particularly the unexpectedly important role of voting populations west of the interstate and high turnout across the city as a result of vote by mail and a higly compeditive election. 53.6% of the city voted in the 2015 Race, yielding a higher turnout than that of the 2014 mid-terms election for Utah's second U.S. Congressional District (52.1% across Salt Lake City).

	Additionally, turnout in this year's election was also unexpectedly high amongst those on the west side of the city (and favored Biskupski across the board). Whilst this does not have any immediate consequences it does pose an interesting question when it comes to the voter participation of relatively lower socio-economic demographics (particularly in compeditive races).

	Finally, after looking over the numbers, I'm sorry to report that the introduction of vote by mail will not have a big enough affect on the electorate to see U.S. Congressional 2 brought into play by itself. Currently Salt Lake County makes up approximately 60% of the total population for the area, with large portions also coming from Davis county and Washington county (St George and surrounds). Any candidate might look to contest this election should have a serious plan for the latter two counties because without it, the race would require 60% of the vote to be democratic in Salt Lake (likely) and 95% turnout (not a chance).
